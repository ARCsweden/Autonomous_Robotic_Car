This is a test program for the reflective sensor, used for the encoder part of the robot.

# Library installation
Note! Some of the code is in libraries. Copy the `libraries` folder and all its contents into your local sketchbook directory. Find out what your sketchbook directory is by opening the preferences of Arduino.

Once the code has been copied, the code should compile.
